# Pac-Man in Maze World

## Project Overview
The **Pac-Man in Maze World** is designed to create a **navigation system** for Pac-Man to his favourite destination in a haunted maze full of ghosts. It uses **Depth First Search(DFS)** algorithm to find his path and it is implemented using **Stack** data structure.

### Key Features:
- Add, remove and check ghost in the Maze World.
- Retrieve the Maze information.
- Find path from starting to ending point.
- Efficient handling of navigator class with Stack data structure.

### Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: O(n * m) for find path function.
- **Space complexity**: O(n * m), where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in the Maze.

### Algorithms:
- **Depth First Search**: Conducts exhaustive search by moving forward if possible and backtracking, if necessary.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Stacks
- OOPS Concept
